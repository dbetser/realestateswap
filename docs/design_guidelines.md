# Design Guidelines – First-Time 1031 Concierge

## 🎨 Visual Style
- **Font**: Inter (modern, legible, web-optimized)
- **Primary Color**: #1746A2 – Deep Blue (trust, reliability)
- **Accent Color**: #00A6FB – Fresh Light Blue (guidance, friendliness)
- **Backgrounds**:
  - White for clarity and simplicity
  - Soft Gray (#F5F7FA) for contrast sections or subtle dividers

## 📱 Layout Principles
- **Mobile-first design**: Optimized for small screens first, scales up to desktop
- **Card-based UI**: Each expert, checklist item, and property lives in a tidy, scrollable card
- **Clear CTAs**: Buttons like “Start Your 1031 Timeline” and “Book Now” always visible
- **Whitespace is key**: Keep breathing room between elements to avoid clutter

## 🔁 Reusable UI Components
- Card (expert profile, property preview)
- Timeline step item (title, due date, status)
- Filter chips (service type, lease length, etc.)
- Booking CTA module (price, Stripe button, Calendly embed)

## ♿ Accessibility Considerations
- High contrast text on buttons and forms
- Screen-reader-friendly labels on forms
- Mobile touch targets: 44px minimum height

## 🗣️ Brand Tone & Voice
- **Trustworthy** – Simplifies complex legal/tax processes without dumbing them down
- **Professional** – Feels vetted, premium, and clean
- **Helpful & Human** – Encouraging language for first-time users (e.g., “You’re doing great!”)

## 🧪 Usability Notes
- Keep language plain and readable (8th-grade level)
- Avoid jargon unless explained inline
- Success states and progress indicators help reduce user anxiety

## 💡 Inspiration Sources
- TurboTax (guided legal forms)
- Opendoor (clean, modern RE platform)
- Stripe (friendly and polished UI language)
